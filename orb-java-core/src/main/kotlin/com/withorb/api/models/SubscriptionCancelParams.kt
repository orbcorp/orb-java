/**
 * This endpoint can be used to cancel an existing subscription. It returns the serialized
 * subscription object with an `end_date` parameter that signifies when the subscription will
 * transition to an ended state.
 *
 * The body parameter `cancel_option` determines the cancellation behavior. Orb supports three
 * cancellation options:
 * - `end_of_subscription_term`: stops the subscription from auto-renewing. Subscriptions that have
 *   been cancelled with this option can still incur charges for the remainder of their term:
 *     - Issuing this cancellation request for a monthly subscription will keep the subscription
 *       active until the start of the subsequent month, and potentially issue an invoice for any
 *       usage charges incurred in the intervening period.
 *     - Issuing this cancellation request for a quarterly subscription will keep the subscription
 *       active until the end of the quarter and potentially issue an invoice for any usage charges
 *       incurred in the intervening period.
 *     - Issuing this cancellation request for a yearly subscription will keep the subscription
 *       active for the full year. For example, a yearly subscription starting on 2021-11-01 and
 *       cancelled on 2021-12-08 will remain active until 2022-11-01 and potentially issue charges
 *       in the intervening months for any recurring monthly usage charges in its plan.
 *     - **Note**: If a subscription's plan contains prices with difference cadences, the end of
 *       term date will be determined by the largest cadence value. For example, cancelling end of
 *       term for a subscription with a quarterly fixed fee with a monthly usage fee will result in
 *       the subscription ending at the end of the quarter.
 * - `immediate`: ends the subscription immediately, setting the `end_date` to the current time:
 *     - Subscriptions that have been cancelled with this option will be invoiced immediately. This
 *       invoice will include any usage fees incurred in the billing period up to the cancellation,
 *       along with any prorated recurring fees for the billing period, if applicable.
 *     - **Note**: If the subscription has a recurring fee that was paid in-advance, the prorated
 *       amount for the remaining time period will be added to the
 *       [customer's balance](list-balance-transactions) upon immediate cancellation. However, if
 *       the customer is ineligible to use the customer balance, the subscription cannot be
 *       cancelled immediately.
 * - `requested_date`: ends the subscription on a specified date, which requires a
 *   `cancellation_date` to be passed in. If no timezone is provided, the customer's timezone is
 *   used. For example, a subscription starting on January 1st with a monthly price can be set to be
 *   cancelled on the first of any month after January 1st (e.g. March 1st, April 1st, May 1st). A
 *   subscription with multiple prices with different cadences defines the "term" to be the highest
 *   cadence of the prices.
 *
 * Upcoming subscriptions are only eligible for immediate cancellation, which will set the
 * `end_date` equal to the `start_date` upon cancellation.
 *
 * ## Backdated cancellations
 *
 * Orb allows you to cancel a subscription in the past as long as there are no paid invoices between
 * the `requested_date` and the current time. If the cancellation is after the latest issued
 * invoice, Orb will generate a balance refund for the current period. If the cancellation is before
 * the most recently issued invoice, Orb will void the intervening invoice and generate a new one
 * based on the new dates for the subscription. See the section on
 * [cancellation behaviors](/product-catalog/creating-subscriptions#cancellation-behaviors).
