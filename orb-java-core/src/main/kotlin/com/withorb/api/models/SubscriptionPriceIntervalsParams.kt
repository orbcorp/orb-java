/**
 * This endpoint is used to add and edit subscription
 * [price intervals](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals). By making
 * modifications to a subscription’s price intervals, you can
 * [flexibly and atomically control the billing behavior of a subscription](/product-catalog/modifying-subscriptions).
 *
 * ## Adding price intervals
 *
 * Prices can be added as price intervals to a subscription by specifying them in the `add` array. A
 * `price_id` or `external_price_id` from an add-on price or previously removed plan price can be
 * specified to reuse an existing price definition (however, please note that prices from other
 * plans cannot be added to the subscription). Additionally, a new price can be specified using the
 * `price` field — this price will be created automatically.
 *
 * A `start_date` must be specified for the price interval. This is the date when the price will
 * start billing on the subscription, so this will notably result in an immediate charge at this
 * time for any billed in advance fixed fees. The `end_date` will default to null, resulting in a
 * price interval that will bill on a continually recurring basis. Both of these dates can be set in
 * the past or the future and Orb will generate or modify invoices to ensure the subscription’s
 * invoicing behavior is correct.
 *
 * Additionally, a discount, minimum, or maximum can be specified on the price interval. This will
 * only apply to this price interval, not any other price intervals on the subscription.
 *
 * ## Adjustment intervals
 *
 * An adjustment interval represents the time period that a particular adjustment (a discount,
 * minimum, or maximum) applies to the prices on a subscription. Adjustment intervals can be added
 * to a subscription by specifying them in the `add_adjustments` array, or modified via the
 * `edit_adjustments` array. When creating an adjustment interval, you'll need to provide the
 * definition of the new adjustment (the type of adjustment, and which prices it applies to), as
 * well as the start and end dates for the adjustment interval. The start and end dates of an
 * existing adjustment interval can be edited via the `edit_adjustments` field (just like price
 * intervals). (To "change" the amount of a discount, minimum, or maximum, then, you'll need to end
 * the existing interval, and create a new adjustment interval with the new amount and a start date
 * that matches the end date of the previous interval.)
 *
 * ## Editing price intervals
 *
 * Price intervals can be adjusted by specifying edits to make in the `edit` array. A
 * `price_interval_id` to edit must be specified — this can be retrieved from the `price_intervals`
 * field on the subscription.
 *
 * A new `start_date` or `end_date` can be specified to change the range of the price interval,
 * which will modify past or future invoices to ensure correctness. If either of these dates are
 * unspecified, they will default to the existing date on the price interval. To remove a price
 * interval entirely from a subscription, set the `end_date` to be equivalent to the `start_date`.
 *
 * ## Fixed fee quantity transitions
 * The fixed fee quantity transitions for a fixed fee price interval can also be specified when
 * adding or editing by passing an array for `fixed_fee_quantity_transitions`. A fixed fee quantity
 * transition must have a `quantity` and an `effective_date`, which is the date after which the new
 * quantity will be used for billing. If a fixed fee quantity transition is scheduled at a billing
 * period boundary, the full quantity will be billed on an invoice with the other prices on the
 * subscription. If the fixed fee quantity transition is scheduled mid-billing period, the
 * difference between the existing quantity and quantity specified in the transition will be
 * prorated for the rest of the billing period and billed immediately, which will generate a new
 * invoice.
 *
 * Notably, the list of fixed fee quantity transitions passed will overwrite the existing fixed fee
 * quantity transitions on the price interval, so the entire list of transitions must be specified
 * to add additional transitions. The existing list of transitions can be retrieved using the
 * `fixed_fee_quantity_transitions` property on a subscription’s serialized price intervals.
