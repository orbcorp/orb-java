/**
 * A subscription represents the purchase of a plan by a customer. The customer is identified by
 * either the `customer_id` or the `external_customer_id`, and exactly one of these fields must be
 * provided.
 *
 * By default, subscriptions begin on the day that they're created and renew automatically for each
 * billing cycle at the cadence that's configured in the plan definition.
 *
 * The default configuration for subscriptions in Orb is **In-advance billing** and **Beginning of
 * month alignment** (see [Subscription](/core-concepts##subscription) for more details).
 *
 * In order to change the alignment behavior, Orb also supports billing subscriptions on the day of
 * the month they are created. If `align_billing_with_subscription_start_date = true` is specified,
 * subscriptions have billing cycles that are aligned with their `start_date`. For example, a
 * subscription that begins on January 15th will have a billing cycle from January 15th to February
 * 15th. Every subsequent billing cycle will continue to start and invoice on the 15th.
 *
 * If the "day" value is greater than the number of days in the month, the next billing cycle will
 * start at the end of the month. For example, if the start_date is January 31st, the next billing
 * cycle will start on February 28th.
 *
 * If a customer was created with a currency, Orb only allows subscribing the customer to a plan
 * with a matching `invoicing_currency`. If the customer does not have a currency set, on
 * subscription creation, we set the customer's currency to be the `invoicing_currency` of the plan.
 *
 * ## Customize your customer's subscriptions
 *
 * Prices and adjustments in a plan can be added, removed, or replaced for the subscription being
 * created. This is useful when a customer has prices that differ from the default prices for a
 * specific plan.
 *
 * <Note> This feature is only available for accounts that have migrated to Subscription Overrides
 * Version 2. You can find your Subscription Overrides Version at the bottom of your
 * [Plans page](https://app.withorb.com/plans) </Note>
 *
 * ### Adding Prices
 *
 * To add prices, provide a list of objects with the key `add_prices`. An object in the list must
 * specify an existing add-on price with a `price_id` or `external_price_id` field, or create a new
 * add-on price by including an object with the key `price`, identical to what would be used in the
 * request body for the [create price endpoint](/api-reference/price/create-price). See the
 * [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of different price
 * model configurations possible in this object.
 *
 * If the plan has phases, each object in the list must include a number with `plan_phase_order` key
 * to indicate which phase the price should be added to.
 *
 * An object in the list can specify an optional `start_date` and optional `end_date`. This is
 * equivalent to creating a price interval with the
 * [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
 * If unspecified, the start or end date of the phase or subscription will be used.
 *
 * An object in the list can specify an optional `minimum_amount`, `maximum_amount`, or `discounts`.
 * This will create adjustments which apply only to this price.
 *
 * Additionally, an object in the list can specify an optional `reference_id`. This ID can be used
 * to reference this price when [adding an adjustment](#adding-adjustments) in the same API call.
 * However the ID is _transient_ and cannot be used to refer to the price in future API calls.
 *
 * ### Removing Prices
 *
 * To remove prices, provide a list of objects with the key `remove_prices`. An object in the list
 * must specify a plan price with either a `price_id` or `external_price_id` field.
 *
 * ### Replacing Prices
 *
 * To replace prices, provide a list of objects with the key `replace_prices`. An object in the list
 * must specify a plan price to replace with the `replaces_price_id` key, and it must specify a
 * price to replace it with by either referencing an existing add-on price with a `price_id` or
 * `external_price_id` field, or by creating a new add-on price by including an object with the key
 * `price`, identical to what would be used in the request body for the
 * [create price endpoint](/api-reference/price/create-price). See the
 * [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of different price
 * model configurations possible in this object.
 *
 * For fixed fees, an object in the list can supply a `fixed_price_quantity` instead of a `price`,
 * `price_id`, or `external_price_id` field. This will update only the quantity for the price,
 * similar to the [Update price quantity](/api-reference/subscription/update-price-quantity)
 * endpoint.
 *
 * The replacement price will have the same phase, if applicable, and the same start and end dates
 * as the price it replaces.
 *
 * An object in the list can specify an optional `minimum_amount`, `maximum_amount`, or `discounts`.
 * This will create adjustments which apply only to this price.
 *
 * Additionally, an object in the list can specify an optional `reference_id`. This ID can be used
 * to reference the replacement price when [adding an adjustment](#adding-adjustments) in the same
 * API call. However the ID is _transient_ and cannot be used to refer to the price in future API
 * calls.
 *
 * ### Adding adjustments
 *
 * To add adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key `add_adjustments`. An object in the
 * list must include an object with the key `adjustment`, identical to the adjustment object in the
 * [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
 *
 * If the plan has phases, each object in the list must include a number with `plan_phase_order` key
 * to indicate which phase the adjustment should be added to.
 *
 * An object in the list can specify an optional `start_date` and optional `end_date`. If
 * unspecified, the start or end date of the phase or subscription will be used.
 *
 * ### Removing adjustments
 *
 * To remove adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key `remove_adjustments`. An object in
 * the list must include a key, `adjustment_id`, with the ID of the adjustment to be removed.
 *
 * ### Replacing adjustments
 *
 * To replace adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key `replace_adjustments`. An object
 * in the list must specify a plan adjustment to replace with the `replaces_adjustment_id` key, and
 * it must specify an adjustment to replace it with by including an object with the key
 * `adjustment`, identical to the adjustment object in the
 * [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
 *
 * The replacement adjustment will have the same phase, if applicable, and the same start and end
 * dates as the adjustment it replaces.
 *
 * ## Price overrides (DEPRECATED)
 *
 * <Note> Price overrides are being phased out in favor adding/removing/replacing prices. (See
 * [Customize your customer's subscriptions](/api-reference/subscription/create-subscription))
 * </Note>
 *
 * Price overrides are used to update some or all prices in a plan for the specific subscription
 * being created. This is useful when a new customer has negotiated a rate that is unique to the
 * customer.
 *
 * To override prices, provide a list of objects with the key `price_overrides`. The price object in
 * the list of overrides is expected to contain the existing price id, the `model_type` and
 * configuration. (See the [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the
 * specification of different price model configurations.) The numerical values can be updated, but
 * the billable metric, cadence, type, and name of a price can not be overridden.
 *
 * ### Maximums and Minimums
 *
 * Minimums and maximums, much like price overrides, can be useful when a new customer has
 * negotiated a new or different minimum or maximum spend cap than the default for a given price. If
 * one exists for a price and null is provided for the minimum/maximum override on creation, then
 * there will be no minimum/maximum on the new subscription. If no value is provided, then the
 * default price maximum or minimum is used.
 *
 * To add a minimum for a specific price, add `minimum_amount` to the specific price in the
 * `price_overrides` object.
 *
 * To add a maximum for a specific price, add `maximum_amount` to the specific price in the
 * `price_overrides` object.
 *
 * ### Minimum override example
 *
 * Price minimum override example:
 * ```json
 * {
 *   ...
 *   "id": "price_id",
 *   "model_type": "unit",
 *   "unit_config": {
 *     "unit_amount": "0.50"
 *   },
 *   "minimum_amount": "100.00"
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Removing an existing minimum example
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   ...
 *   "id": "price_id",
 *   "model_type": "unit",
 *   "unit_config": {
 *     "unit_amount": "0.50"
 *   },
 *   "minimum_amount": null
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Discounts
 *
 * Discounts, like price overrides, can be useful when a new customer has negotiated a new or
 * different discount than the default for a price. If a discount exists for a price and a null
 * discount is provided on creation, then there will be no discount on the new subscription.
 *
 * To add a discount for a specific price, add `discount` to the price in the `price_overrides`
 * object. Discount should be a dictionary of the format:
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   "discount_type": "amount" | "percentage" | "usage",
 *   "amount_discount": string,
 *   "percentage_discount": string,
 *   "usage_discount": string
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * where either `amount_discount`, `percentage_discount`, or `usage_discount` is provided.
 *
 * Price discount example
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   ...
 *   "id": "price_id",
 *   "model_type": "unit",
 *   "unit_config": {
 *     "unit_amount": "0.50"
 *   },
 *   "discount": {"discount_type": "amount", "amount_discount": "175"},
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Removing an existing discount example
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "customer_id": "customer_id",
 *   "plan_id": "plan_id",
 *   "discount": null,
 *   "price_overrides": [ ... ]
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Threshold Billing
 *
 * Orb supports invoicing for a subscription when a preconfigured usage threshold is hit. To enable
 * threshold billing, pass in an `invoicing_threshold`, which is specified in the subscription's
 * invoicing currency, when creating a subscription. E.g. pass in `10.00` to issue an invoice when
 * usage amounts hit $10.00 for a subscription that invoices in USD.
