     *
     * ## Unit pricing
     *
     * With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     ...
     *     "model_type": "unit",
     *     "unit_config": {
     *         "unit_amount": "0.50"
     *     }
     *     ...
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Tiered pricing
     *
     * In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it falls into,
     * where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the first ten
     * units may cost $0.50 each and all units thereafter may cost $0.10 each.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     ...
     *     "model_type": "tiered",
     *     "tiered_config": {
     *         "tiers": [
     *             {
     *                 "first_unit": 1,
     *                 "last_unit": 10,
     *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
     *             },
     *             {
     *                 "first_unit": 11,
     *                 "last_unit": null,
     *                 "unit_amount": "0.10"
     *             }
     *         ]
     *     }
     *     ...
     * ```
     *
     * ## Bulk pricing
     *
     * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units. For example,
     * if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a total of $5.00. Once you've
     * bought more than 10 units, all units may now be priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would
     * be $40.40).
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     ...
     *     "model_type": "bulk",
     *     "bulk_config": {
     *         "tiers": [
     *             {
     *                 "maximum_units": 10,
     *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
     *             },
     *             {
     *                 "maximum_units": 1000,
     *                 "unit_amount": "0.40"
     *             }
     *         ]
     *     }
     *     ...
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Package pricing
     *
     * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes. For example,
     * if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5 and 6 units will be billed
     * at 10.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     ...
     *     "model_type": "package",
     *     "package_config": {
     *         "package_amount": "0.80",
     *         "package_size": 10
     *     }
     *     ...
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## BPS pricing
     *
     * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a percent (the
     * number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to assess. For example, this
     * would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every payment you process, with a maximum charge
     * of $25 per payment.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     ...
     *     "model_type": "bps",
     *     "bps_config": {
     *        "bps": 125,
     *        "per_unit_maximum": "11.00"
     *     }
     *     ...
     *  }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Bulk BPS pricing
     *
     * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the total quantity
     * across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
     * the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each tier range is defined by an upper
     * bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment volume is reached, each individual payment may
     * have a lower cap or a smaller take-rate.
     *
     * ```json
     *     ...
     *     "model_type": "bulk_bps",
     *     "bulk_bps_config": {
     *         "tiers": [
     *            {
     *                 "maximum_amount": "1000000.00",
     *                 "bps": 125,
     *                 "per_unit_maximum": "19.00"
     *            },
     *           {
     *                 "maximum_amount": null,
     *                 "bps": 115,
     *                 "per_unit_maximum": "4.00"
     *             }
     *         ]
     *     }
     *     ...
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Tiered BPS pricing
     *
     * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an event's
     * applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period total. Similar to
     * tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on the tier range that it falls
     * into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the first
     * few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate and all payments after a specific volume may incur
     * a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
     *
     * ```json
     *     ...
     *     "model_type": "tiered_bps",
     *     "tiered_bps_config": {
     *         "tiers": [
     *            {
     *                 "minimum_amount": "0",
     *                 "maximum_amount": "1000000.00",
     *                 "bps": 125,
     *                 "per_unit_maximum": "19.00"
     *            },
     *           {
     *                 "minimum_amount": "1000000.00",
     *                 "maximum_amount": null,
     *                 "bps": 115,
     *                 "per_unit_maximum": "4.00"
     *             }
     *         ]
     *     }
     *     ...
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Matrix pricing
     *
     * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix. `dimensions`
     * defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing model. In a one-dimensional
     * matrix, the second value is `null`. Every configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which
     * give the unit prices for specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix
     * values will have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
     * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
     * `default_unit_amount`.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     "model_type": "matrix"
     *     "matrix_config": {
     *         "default_unit_amount": "3.00",
     *         "dimensions": [
     *             "cluster_name",
     *             "region"
     *         ],
     *         "matrix_values": [
     *             {
     *                 "dimension_values": [
     *                     "alpha",
     *                     "west"
     *                 ],
     *                 "unit_amount": "2.00"
     *             },
     *             ...
     *         ]
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Fixed fees
     *
     * Fixed fees are prices that are applied independent of usage quantities, and follow unit
     * pricing. They also have an additional parameter `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price
     * represents a fixed cost, this represents the quantity of units applied.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     ...
     *     "id": "price_id",
     *     "model_type": "unit",
     *     "unit_config": {
     *        "unit_amount": "2.00"
     *     },
     *     "fixed_price_quantity": 3.0
     *     ...
     * }

     *
     * ## Tiered BPS pricing
     *
     * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an event's
     * applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period total. Similar to
     * tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on the tier range that it falls
     * into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the first
     * few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate and all payments after a specific volume may incur
     * a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
     *
     * ```json
     *     ...
     *     "model_type": "tiered_bps",
     *     "tiered_bps_config": {
     *         "tiers": [
     *            {
     *                 "minimum_amount": "0",
     *                 "maximum_amount": "1000000.00",
     *                 "bps": 125,
     *                 "per_unit_maximum": "19.00"
     *            },
     *           {
     *                 "minimum_amount": "1000000.00",
     *                 "maximum_amount": null,
     *                 "bps": 115,
     *                 "per_unit_maximum": "4.00"
     *             }
     *         ]
     *     }
     *     ...
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Matrix pricing
     *
     * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix. `dimensions`
     * defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing model. In a one-dimensional
     * matrix, the second value is `null`. Every configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which
     * give the unit prices for specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix
     * values will have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
     * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
     * `default_unit_amount`.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     "model_type": "matrix"
     *     "matrix_config": {
     *         "default_unit_amount": "3.00",
     *         "dimensions": [
     *             "cluster_name",
     *             "region"
     *         ],
     *         "matrix_values": [
     *             {
     *                 "dimension_values": [
     *                     "alpha",
     *                     "west"
     *                 ],
     *                 "unit_amount": "2.00"
     *             },
     *             ...
     *         ]
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Fixed fees
     *
     * Fixed fees are prices that are applied independent of usage quantities, and follow unit
     * pricing. They also have an additional parameter `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price
     * represents a fixed cost, this represents the quantity of units applied.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     ...
     *     "id": "price_id",
     *     "model_type": "unit",
     *     "unit_config": {
     *        "unit_amount": "2.00"
     *     },
     *     "fixed_price_quantity": 3.0
     *     ...

         * ## Unit pricing
         *
         * With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "unit",
         *     "unit_config": {
         *         "unit_amount": "0.50"
         *     }
         *     ...
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * ## Tiered pricing
         *
         * In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it falls into,
         * where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the first ten
         * units may cost $0.50 each and all units thereafter may cost $0.10 each.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "tiered",
         *     "tiered_config": {
         *         "tiers": [
         *             {
         *                 "first_unit": 1,
         *                 "last_unit": 10,
         *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
         *             },
         *             {
         *                 "first_unit": 11,
         *                 "last_unit": null,
         *                 "unit_amount": "0.10"
         *             }
         *         ]

         *     ...
         * ```
         *
         * ## Bulk pricing
         *
         * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units. For
         * example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a total of
         * $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be priced at $0.40 (i.e.
         * 101 units total would be $40.40).
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "bulk",
         *     "bulk_config": {
         *         "tiers": [
         *             {
         *                 "maximum_units": 10,
         *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
         *             },
         *             {
         *                 "maximum_units": 1000,
         *                 "unit_amount": "0.40"
         *             }
         *         ]
         *     }
         *     ...
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * ## Package pricing
         *
         * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes. For
         * example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5 and 6 units
         * will be billed at 10.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "package",
         *     "package_config": {
         *         "package_amount": "0.80",
         *         "package_size": 10
         *     }
         *     ...
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * ## BPS pricing
         *
         * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a percent
         * (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to assess. For
         * example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every payment you process, with
         * a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "bps",
         *     "bps_config": {
         *        "bps": 125,
         *        "per_unit_maximum": "11.00"
         *     }
         *     ...
         *  }
         * ```
         *
         * ## Bulk BPS pricing
         *
         * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the total
         * quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event
         * depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each tier range is defined
         * by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment volume is reached, each individual
         * payment may have a lower cap or a smaller take-rate.
         *
         * ```json
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "bulk_bps",
         *     "bulk_bps_config": {
         *         "tiers": [
         *            {
         *                 "maximum_amount": "1000000.00",
         *                 "bps": 125,

         * ## Tiered BPS pricing
         *
         * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an event's
         * applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period total. Similar
         * to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on the tier range that it
         * falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example,
         * the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate and all payments after a specific
         * volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
         *
         * ```json

         * ## Matrix pricing
         *
         * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
         * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing model. In a
         * one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every configuration has a list of
         * `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for specified property values. In a
         * one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will have `dimension_values` where the second
         * value of the pair is null. If an event does not match any of the dimension values in the
         * matrix, it will resort to the `default_unit_amount`.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     "model_type": "matrix"

         *     }
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * ## Fixed fees
         *
         * Fixed fees are prices that are applied independent of usage quantities, and follow unit
         * pricing. They also have an additional parameter `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price
         * represents a fixed cost, this represents the quantity of units applied.
         *

        /**
         * The Price resource represents a price that can be billed on a subscription, resulting in

         *
         * Orb supports a few different pricing models out of the box. Each of these models is

         * ## Unit pricing
         *
         * With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "unit",

         * }
         * ```
         *
         * ## Tiered pricing
         *
         * In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it falls into,
         * where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the first ten
         * units may cost $0.50 each and all units thereafter may cost $0.10 each.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "tiered",
         *     "tiered_config": {
         *         "tiers": [
         *             {
         *                 "first_unit": 1,
         *                 "last_unit": 10,
         *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"

         *     ...
         * ```
         *
         * ## Bulk pricing
         *
         * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units. For
         * example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a total of
         * $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be priced at $0.40 (i.e.
         * 101 units total would be $40.40).
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "bulk",
         *     "bulk_config": {
         *         "tiers": [

         *     ...
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * ## Package pricing
         *
         * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes. For
         * example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5 and 6 units
         * will be billed at 10.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "package",
         *     "package_config": {
         *         "package_amount": "0.80",
         *         "package_size": 10
         *     }
         *     ...
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * ## BPS pricing
         *
         * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a percent
         * (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to assess. For
         * example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every payment you process, with
         * a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
         *
         * ```json
         * {
         *     ...
         *     "model_type": "bps",
         *     "bps_config": {
         *        "bps": 125,
         *        "per_unit_maximum": "11.00"
         *     }
         *     ...
         *  }
         * ```
         *
         * ## Bulk BPS pricing
         *
         * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the total
         * quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event
         * depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each tier range is defined
         * by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment volume is reached, each individual
         * payment may have a lower cap or a smaller take-rate.
         *
