             * The Price resource represents a price that can be billed on a subscription, resulting
             * in a charge on an invoice in the form of an invoice line item. Prices take a quantity
             * and determine an amount to bill.
             *
             * Orb supports a few different pricing models out of the box. Each of these models is
             * serialized differently in a given Price object. The model_type field determines the
             * key for the configuration object that is present.
             *
             * ## Unit pricing
             *
             * With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.
             *
             * ```json
             * {
             *     ...
             *     "model_type": "unit",
             *     "unit_config": {
             *         "unit_amount": "0.50"
             *     }
             *     ...
             * }
             * ```
             *
             * ## Tiered pricing
             *
             * In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it falls
             * into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the
             * first ten units may cost $0.50 each and all units thereafter may cost $0.10 each.
             *
             * ```json
             * {
             *     ...
             *     "model_type": "tiered",
             *     "tiered_config": {
             *         "tiers": [
             *             {
             *                 "first_unit": 1,
             *                 "last_unit": 10,
             *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
             *             },
             *             {
             *                 "first_unit": 11,
             *                 "last_unit": null,
             *                 "unit_amount": "0.10"
             *             }
             *         ]
             *     }
             *     ...
             * ```
             *
             * ## Bulk pricing
             *
             * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units. For
             * example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a total of
             * $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be priced at $0.40
             * (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
             *
             * ```json
             * {
             *     ...
             *     "model_type": "bulk",
             *     "bulk_config": {
             *         "tiers": [
             *             {
             *                 "maximum_units": 10,
             *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
             *             },
             *             {
             *                 "maximum_units": 1000,
             *                 "unit_amount": "0.40"
             *             }
             *         ]
             *     }
             *     ...
             * }
             * ```
             *
             * ## Package pricing
             *
             * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes. For
             * example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5 and 6
             * units will be billed at 10.
             *
             * ```json
             * {
             *     ...
             *     "model_type": "package",
             *     "package_config": {
             *         "package_amount": "0.80",
             *         "package_size": 10
             *     }
             *     ...
             * }
             * ```
             *
             * ## BPS pricing
             *
             * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
             * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to assess.
             * For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every payment you
             * process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
             *
             * ```json
             * {
             *     ...
             *     "model_type": "bps",
             *     "bps_config": {
             *        "bps": 125,
             *        "per_unit_maximum": "11.00"
             *     }
             *     ...
             *  }
             * ```
             *
             * ## Bulk BPS pricing
             *
             * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the total
             * quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of a given
             * event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each tier range
             * is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment volume is reached,
             * each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller take-rate.
             *
             * ```json

             *
             * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an event's

             *
             * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
             * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing model.
             * In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every configuration has a

             * In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it falls
             * into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For example, the

             * ## Bulk pricing
             *
             * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units. For
             * example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a total of
             * $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be priced at $0.40
             * (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
             *
             * ```json
             * {
             *     ...

             *
             * ## Package pricing
             *
             * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes. For
             * example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5 and 6
             * units will be billed at 10.

             * ```json

             *     "package_config": {
             *         "package_amount": "0.80",

             *
             * ## BPS pricing
             *
             * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
             * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to assess.
             * For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every payment you
             * process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
             *
             * ```json
             * {
             *     ...

             *     "bps_config": {
             *        "bps": 125,

             *     ...
             *  }
             * ```
             *
             * ## Bulk BPS pricing
             *
             * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the total
             * quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of a given
             * event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each tier range
             * is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment volume is reached,
             * each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller take-rate.

                 *
                 * With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.

                 *
                 * In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it
                 * falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For

                 * ## Bulk pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "package",
                 *     "package_config": {

                 *
                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",
                 *     "bps_config": {

                 *        "per_unit_maximum": "11.00"
                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 *  }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.

                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",
                 *     "bps_config": {
                 *        "bps": 125,

                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 *  }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 *
                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * ## Matrix pricing
                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * follow unit pricing. They also have an additional parameter
                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "package",
                 *     "package_config": {

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",
                 *     "bps_config": {
                 *        "bps": 125,

                 *     }
                 *     ...

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * ## Matrix pricing
                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * follow unit pricing. They also have an additional parameter
                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.

                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the

                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.

                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 * ## Bulk pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",
                 *     "bps_config": {

                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 *  }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * ## Matrix pricing
                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * follow unit pricing. They also have an additional parameter
                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "package",
                 *     "package_config": {
                 *         "package_amount": "0.80",

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",
                 *     "bps_config": {
                 *        "bps": 125,

                 *     }
                 *     ...

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * ## Matrix pricing
                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the

                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the

                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).

                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {

                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.

                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 * ## Unit pricing
                 *
                 * With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "unit",
                 *     "unit_config": {
                 *         "unit_amount": "0.50"
                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 * }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Tiered pricing
                 *
                 * In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it
                 * falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For
                 * example, the first ten units may cost $0.50 each and all units thereafter may
                 * cost $0.10 each.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "tiered",
                 *     "tiered_config": {

                 *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
                 *             },
                 *             {
                 *                 "first_unit": 11,
                 *                 "last_unit": null,
                 *                 "unit_amount": "0.10"
                 *             }
                 *         ]

                 *
                 * ## Bulk pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bulk",

                 *                 "maximum_units": 10,
                 *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
                 *             },
                 *             {
                 *                 "maximum_units": 1000,

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "package",
                 *     "package_config": {
                 *         "package_amount": "0.80",
                 *         "package_size": 10
                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 * }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",
                 *     "bps_config": {
                 *        "bps": 125,
                 *        "per_unit_maximum": "11.00"
                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 *  }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 *
                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## Bulk pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 *
                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *

                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the

                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.

                 * ## Matrix pricing
                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *

                 * Fixed fees are prices that are applied independent of usage quantities, and
                 * follow unit pricing. They also have an additional parameter
                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the

                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).

                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {

                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the

                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an

                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.

                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.

                 * ## Unit pricing
                 *
                 * With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "unit",
                 *     "unit_config": {
                 *         "unit_amount": "0.50"
                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 * }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Tiered pricing
                 *
                 * In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it
                 * falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For
                 * example, the first ten units may cost $0.50 each and all units thereafter may
                 * cost $0.10 each.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "tiered",
                 *     "tiered_config": {

                 *                 "last_unit": 10,
                 *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
                 *             },
                 *             {
                 *                 "first_unit": 11,
                 *                 "last_unit": null,
                 *                 "unit_amount": "0.10"
                 *             }
                 *         ]
                 *     }

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bulk",

                 *                 "maximum_units": 10,
                 *                 "unit_amount": "0.50"
                 *             },
                 *             {
                 *                 "maximum_units": 1000,
                 *                 "unit_amount": "0.40"

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "package",
                 *     "package_config": {
                 *         "package_amount": "0.80",
                 *         "package_size": 10
                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 * }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",
                 *     "bps_config": {
                 *        "bps": 125,
                 *        "per_unit_maximum": "11.00"
                 *     }
                 *     ...
                 *  }
                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## Bulk pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
                 * For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
                 * total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
                 * priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).
                 *

                 * ## Package pricing
                 *
                 * Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
                 * For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
                 * and 6 units will be billed at 10.
                 *
                 * ```json

                 * ## BPS pricing
                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ```
                 *
                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 *
                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * ## Matrix pricing
                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *

                 * follow unit pricing. They also have an additional parameter
                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the

                 *
                 * BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
                 * percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
                 * assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
                 * payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {
                 *     ...
                 *     "model_type": "bps",

                 * ## Bulk BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
                 * total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
                 * a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
                 * tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
                 * volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
                 * take-rate.

                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.

                 * ## Matrix pricing
                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *

                 * ## Tiered BPS pricing
                 *
                 * Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
                 * event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the period
                 * total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event depends on
                 * the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper
                 * and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8 BPS take-rate
                 * and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of 0.5 BPS each.
                 *

                 * ## Matrix pricing
                 *
                 * Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
                 * `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
                 * model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
                 * configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
                 * specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
                 * have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
                 * does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
                 * `default_unit_amount`.
                 *
                 * ```json
                 * {

                 * ## Fixed fees
                 *
                 * Fixed fees are prices that are applied independent of usage quantities, and
                 * follow unit pricing. They also have an additional parameter
                 * `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents the
                 * quantity of units applied.
