    /**
     * This endpoint is used to evaluate the output of a price for a given customer and time range.
     * It enables filtering and grouping the output using
     * [computed properties](../guides/extensibility/advanced-metrics#computed-properties),
     * supporting the following workflows:
     * 1. Showing detailed usage and costs to the end customer.
     * 2. Auditing subtotals on invoice line items.
     *
     * For these workflows, the expressiveness of computed properties in both the filters and
     * grouping is critical. For example, if you'd like to show your customer their usage grouped by
     * hour and another property, you can do so with the following `grouping_keys`:
     * `["hour_floor_timestamp_millis(timestamp_millis)", "my_property"]`. If you'd like to examine
     * a customer's usage for a specific property value, you can do so with the following `filter`:
     * `my_property = 'foo' AND my_other_property = 'bar'`.
     *
     * By default, the start of the time range must be no more than 100 days ago and the length of
     * the results must be no greater than 1000. Note that this is a POST endpoint rather than a GET
     * endpoint because it employs a JSON body rather than query parameters.
