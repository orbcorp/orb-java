    /**
     * The credits ledger provides _auditing_ functionality over Orb's credits system with a list of
     * actions that have taken place to modify a customer's credit balance. This
     * [paginated endpoint](/api-reference/pagination) lists these entries, starting from the most
     * recent ledger entry.
     *
     * More details on using Orb's real-time credit feature are
     * [here](/product-catalog/prepurchase).
     *
     * There are four major types of modifications to credit balance, detailed below.
     *
     * ## Increment
     *
     * Credits (which optionally expire on a future date) can be added via the API ([Add Ledger
     * Entry](create-ledger-entry)). The ledger entry for such an action will always contain the
     * total eligible starting and ending balance for the customer at the time the entry was added
     * to the ledger.
     *
     * ## Decrement
     *
     * Deductions can occur as a result of an API call to create a ledger entry (see
     * [Add Ledger Entry](create-ledger-entry)), or automatically as a result of incurring usage.
     * Both ledger entries present the `decrement` entry type.
     *
     * As usage for a customer is reported into Orb, credits may be deducted according to the
     * customer's plan configuration. An automated deduction of this type will result in a ledger
     * entry, also with a starting and ending balance. In order to provide better tracing
     * capabilities for automatic deductions, Orb always associates each automatic deduction with
     * the `event_id` at the time of ingestion, used to pinpoint _why_ credit deduction took place
     * and to ensure that credits are never deducted without an associated usage event.
     *
     * By default, Orb uses an algorithm that automatically deducts from the _soonest expiring
     * credit block_ first in order to ensure that all credits are utilized appropriately. As an
     * example, if trial credits with an expiration date of 2 weeks from now are present for a
     * customer, they will be used before any deductions take place from a non-expiring credit
     * block.
     *
     * If there are multiple blocks with the same expiration date, Orb will deduct from the block
     * with the _lower cost basis_ first (e.g. trial credits with a $0 cost basis before paid
     * credits with a $5.00 cost basis).
     *
     * It's also possible for a single usage event's deduction to _span_ credit blocks. In this
     * case, Orb will deduct from the next block, ending at the credit block which consists of
     * unexpiring credits. Each of these deductions will lead to a _separate_ ledger entry, one per
     * credit block that is deducted from. By default, the customer's total credit balance in Orb
     * can be negative as a result of a decrement.
     *
     * ## Expiration change
     *
     * The expiry of credits can be changed as a result of the API (See
     * [Add Ledger Entry](create-ledger-entry)). This will create a ledger entry that specifies the
     * balance as well as the initial and target expiry dates.
     *
     * Note that for this entry type, `starting_balance` will equal `ending_balance`, and the
     * `amount` represents the balance transferred. The credit block linked to the ledger entry is
     * the source credit block from which there was an expiration change
     *
     * ## Credits expiry
     *
     * When a set of credits expire on pre-set expiration date, the customer's balance automatically
     * reflects this change and adds an entry to the ledger indicating this event. Note that credit
     * expiry should always happen close to a date boundary in the customer's timezone.
     *
     * ## Void initiated
     *
     * Credit blocks can be voided via the API. The `amount` on this entry corresponds to the number
     * of credits that were remaining in the block at time of void. `void_reason` will be populated
     * if the void is created with a reason.
     *
     * ## Void
     *
     * When a set of credits is voided, the customer's balance automatically reflects this change
     * and adds an entry to the ledger indicating this event.
     *
     * ## Amendment
     *
     * When credits are added to a customer's balance as a result of a correction, this entry will
     * be added to the ledger to indicate the adjustment of credits.

     * This endpoint allows you to create a new ledger entry for a specified customer's balance.
     * This can be used to increment balance, deduct credits, and change the expiry date of existing
     * credits.
     *
     * ## Effects of adding a ledger entry
     * 1. After calling this endpoint, [Fetch Credit Balance](fetch-customer-credits) will return a
     *    credit block that represents the changes (i.e. balance changes or transfers).
     * 2. A ledger entry will be added to the credits ledger for this customer, and therefore
     *    returned in the [View Credits Ledger](fetch-customer-credits-ledger) response as well as
     *    serialized in the response to this request. In the case of deductions without a specified
     *    block, multiple ledger entries may be created if the deduction spans credit blocks.
     * 3. If `invoice_settings` is specified, an invoice will be created that reflects the cost of
     *    the credits (based on `amount` and `per_unit_cost_basis`).
     *
     * ## Adding credits
     *
     * Adding credits is done by creating an entry of type `increment`. This requires the caller to
     * specify a number of credits as well as an optional expiry date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Orb
     * also recommends specifying a description to assist with auditing. When adding credits, the
     * caller can also specify a cost basis per-credit, to indicate how much in USD a customer paid
     * for a single credit in a block. This can later be used for revenue recognition.
     *
     * The following snippet illustrates a sample request body to increment credits which will
     * expire in January of 2022.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "entry_type": "increment",
     *   "amount": 100,
     *   "expiry_date": "2022-12-28",
     *   "per_unit_cost_basis": "0.20",
     *   "description": "Purchased 100 credits"
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Note that by default, Orb will always first increment any _negative_ balance in existing
     * blocks before adding the remaining amount to the desired credit block.
     *
     * ### Invoicing for credits
     *
     * By default, Orb manipulates the credit ledger but does not charge for credits. However, if
     * you pass `invoice_settings` in the body of this request, Orb will also generate a one-off
     * invoice for the customer for the credits pre-purchase. Note that you _must_ provide the
     * `per_unit_cost_basis`, since the total charges on the invoice are calculated by multiplying
     * the cost basis with the number of credit units added.
     *
     * ## Deducting Credits
     *
     * Orb allows you to deduct credits from a customer by creating an entry of type `decrement`.
     * Orb matches the algorithm for automatic deductions for determining which credit blocks to
     * decrement from. In the case that the deduction leads to multiple ledger entries, the response
     * from this endpoint will be the final deduction. Orb also optionally allows specifying a
     * description to assist with auditing.
     *
     * The following snippet illustrates a sample request body to decrement credits.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "entry_type": "decrement",
     *   "amount": 20,
     *   "description": "Removing excess credits"
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Changing credits expiry
     *
     * If you'd like to change when existing credits expire, you should create a ledger entry of
     * type `expiration_change`. For this entry, the required parameter `expiry_date` identifies the
     * _originating_ block, and the required parameter `target_expiry_date` identifies when the
     * transferred credits should now expire. A new credit block will be created with expiry date
     * `target_expiry_date`, with the same cost basis data as the original credit block, if present.
     *
     * Note that the balance of the block with the given `expiry_date` must be at least equal to the
     * desired transfer amount determined by the `amount` parameter.
     *
     * The following snippet illustrates a sample request body to extend the expiration date of
     * credits by one year:
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "entry_type": "expiration_change",
     *   "amount": 10,
     *   "expiry_date": "2022-12-28",
     *   "block_id": "UiUhFWeLHPrBY4Ad",
     *   "target_expiry_date": "2023-12-28",
     *   "description": "Extending credit validity"
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Voiding credits
     *
     * If you'd like to void a credit block, create a ledger entry of type `void`. For this entry,
     * `block_id` is required to identify the block, and `amount` indicates how many credits to
     * void, up to the block's initial balance. Pass in a `void_reason` of `refund` if the void is
     * due to a refund.
     *
     * ## Amendment
     *
     * If you'd like to undo a decrement on a credit block, create a ledger entry of type
     * `amendment`. For this entry, `block_id` is required to identify the block that was originally
     * decremented from, and `amount` indicates how many credits to return to the customer, up to
     * the block's initial balance.

     * When credits are added to a customer's balance as a result of a correction, this entry will
     * be added to the ledger to indicate the adjustment of credits.
