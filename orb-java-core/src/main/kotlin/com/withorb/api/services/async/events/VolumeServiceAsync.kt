     * [timestamp](../reference/ingest#determining-event-timestamp) field is used to determine which
     * hour an event is associated with. Note, this means that late-arriving events increment the
     * volume count for the hour window the timestamp is in, not the latest hour window.
     *
     * Each item in the response contains the count of events aggregated by the hour where the start
     * and end time are hour-aligned and in UTC. When a specific timestamp is passed in for either
     * start or end time, the response includes the hours the timestamp falls in.
