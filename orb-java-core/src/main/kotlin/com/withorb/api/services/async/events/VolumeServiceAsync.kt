     * The event volume is aggregated by the hour and the
     * [timestamp](/api-reference/event/ingest-events) field is used to determine which hour an
     * event is associated with. Note, this means that late-arriving events increment the volume
     * count for the hour window the timestamp is in, not the latest hour window.
     *
     * Each item in the response contains the count of events aggregated by the hour where the start
     * and end time are hour-aligned and in UTC. When a specific timestamp is passed in for either
     * start or end time, the response includes the hours the timestamp falls in.
